# Event Handling

> inkx makes it easy to graduate from raw key callbacks to composable event pipelines — adopt each level only when you need it.

Your first inkx app calls `useInput` and handles keys directly. That's enough for a counter, a file picker, a simple dialog. Then your TUI grows — mouse clicks, command palettes, vim modes, file watchers — and each requirement tempts you to add another ad-hoc handler or special case.

This guide shows a different path. Each level builds on the last with minimal changes. inkx provides tooling at each step — `withDomEvents`, `withCommands`, app plugins, typed event streams — so the transition is mechanical, not architectural. You never rewrite; you graduate.

The patterns are general — component-level handlers, commands as data, plugin composition — but inkx provides the plumbing so you don't wire it yourself.

| Level | You need it when... | What inkx provides |
|-------|--------------------|--------------------|
| **1 — Callbacks** | Starting out | `useInput` — just a function |
| **2 — Component Handlers** | Clicks, per-component keys | `withDomEvents()` — React-style `onClick`/`onKeyDown` with bubbling |
| **3 — Commands** | Undo, replay, AI automation | `withCommands()` — key/mouse → named serializable actions |
| **4 — App Plugins** | Vim modes, chords, custom sources | `(app) => app` — same shape for processing and production |

Most simple apps stop at Level 1. Apps with mouse interaction reach Level 2. Complex TUIs with customizable keybindings and AI automation land at Level 3. Level 4 is the escape hatch for anything the built-ins don't cover.

This guide is the companion to [State Management](state-management.md). State management answers "how do I organize my data?"; event handling answers "how do I respond to the world?". They meet in the middle at commands — where input becomes data.

### The kernel and defaults

Under the hood, `run()` is sugar over `pipe()` with sensible defaults. The kernel — `createApp(store)` — is just a typed event loop: `update`, `dispatch`, `run`. Everything else is plugins.

```tsx
// Simple: batteries included
await run(store, <App />, { mouse: true, kitty: true })

// Equivalent to:
const app = pipe(
  createApp(store),               // kernel: event loop + state
  withReact(<App />),             // rendering: React reconciler + virtual buffer
  withOutput(stdout),             // terminal: alternate screen, raw mode, diff output
  withTerminal(stdin),            // source: stdin → key/mouse/paste events
  withResize(stdout),             // source: SIGWINCH → resize events
  withLifecycle(),                // processing: Ctrl+Z suspend, Ctrl+C exit
  withFocus(),                    // processing: Tab/Shift+Tab, focus scopes
  withMouse(),                    // protocol: enable SGR mouse tracking
  withKitty(),                    // protocol: enable Kitty keyboard
  withDomEvents(),                // processing: dispatch to component tree
)
await app.run()

// Power user: pick exactly what you need
const app = pipe(
  createApp(store),
  withReact(<Board />),
  withOutput(stdout),
  withTerminal(stdin),
  withDomEvents(),
  withCommands(registry),
  withKeybindings(bindings),
  withDiagnostics(),
)
```

This means you can also run **without** certain plugins:

```tsx
// Headless testing — no terminal, no rendering, just state + commands
const app = pipe(createApp(store), withCommands(registry))
app.dispatch({ type: "term:key", data: { input: "j", key: parseKey("j") } })

// Static rendering — render once, output, exit
const app = pipe(createApp(store), withStaticRender(<Report />))

// Replay — feed recorded events instead of stdin
const app = pipe(createApp(store), withReact(<Board />), withReplaySource(recording))
```

---

## Level 1: Callbacks

You're building a counter. One component, one handler. `useInput` gives you every keypress as a string — do what you want with it.

```tsx
import { run, useInput } from "inkx/runtime"
import { Text } from "inkx"

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)

  useInput((input, key) => {
    if (input === "j") setCount((c) => c + 1)
    if (input === "k") setCount((c) => c - 1)
    if (input === "q") return "exit"
  })

  return <Text>Count: {count}</Text>
}

await run(<Counter />)
```

`useInput` registers a callback that receives raw key data. `run()` manages terminal I/O — raw mode, alternate screen, cleanup. Return `"exit"` to quit.

This is enough for dashboards, simple lists, and anything where one handler can see all input.

**The wall**: You add a sidebar and a main panel. Both need to handle clicks. You want `<Text onClick={...}>` like React DOM — but there's no DOM in a terminal, and `useInput` doesn't know about spatial coordinates.

---

## Level 2: Component Handlers

The counter grows into an interactive board. You need click targets, hover effects, and keyboard handlers on specific components — not a single global callback for everything.

The `withDomEvents()` plugin adds React-style event handlers to inkx components. Events bubble up the tree, components can stop propagation, and hit testing maps mouse coordinates to nodes:

```tsx
import { createApp, useApp } from "inkx/runtime"
import { Box, Text } from "inkx"

function ItemList() {
  const items = useApp((s) => s.items)
  const cursor = useApp((s) => s.cursor)

  return (
    <Box flexDirection="column">
      {items.map((item, i) => (
        <Box
          key={item.id}
          onClick={() => store.setCursor(i)}
          onDoubleClick={() => store.startEdit(i)}
        >
          <Text color={i === cursor ? "cyan" : undefined}>
            {i === cursor ? "> " : "  "}{item.text}
          </Text>
        </Box>
      ))}
    </Box>
  )
}
```

Enable it with a plugin — one line:

```tsx
import { pipe, withDomEvents } from "inkx/runtime"

const app = pipe(
  createApp(store, <Board />),
  withDomEvents(),
)
```

### How it works

`withDomEvents()` overrides `app.update` to intercept events before the base handler:

- **Keyboard events**: dispatched through the focus tree (capture phase → target → bubble phase). Components with `onKeyDown` or `onKeyDownCapture` receive a `KeyEvent` with `stopPropagation()` and `preventDefault()`.
- **Mouse events**: hit-tested against the render tree using `screenRect`. The deepest node at `(x, y)` receives the event, which bubbles up through ancestors. `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onWheel` — same as React DOM.

If a component calls `event.stopPropagation()`, the event is consumed — the base handler never sees it. Unhandled events pass through to whatever is next in the pipeline.

```tsx
<Box onKeyDown={(e) => {
  if (e.key.escape) {
    closeDialog()
    e.stopPropagation()  // don't let Escape reach the parent
  }
}}>
  <TextInput value={query} onChange={setQuery} />
</Box>
```

### Available event handler props

| Prop | Event Type | Bubbles |
|------|-----------|---------|
| `onClick` | `InkxMouseEvent` | Yes |
| `onDoubleClick` | `InkxMouseEvent` | Yes |
| `onMouseDown` | `InkxMouseEvent` | Yes |
| `onMouseUp` | `InkxMouseEvent` | Yes |
| `onMouseMove` | `InkxMouseEvent` | Yes |
| `onMouseEnter` | `InkxMouseEvent` | No |
| `onMouseLeave` | `InkxMouseEvent` | No |
| `onWheel` | `InkxWheelEvent` | Yes |
| `onKeyDown` | `InkxKeyEvent` | Yes |
| `onKeyDownCapture` | `InkxKeyEvent` | Yes (capture phase) |

Component handlers are familiar to React developers, spatial (you click on things), and compositional (events bubble through the tree). This is enough for most interactive UIs.

**The wall**: You want customizable keybindings. But `onClick={() => selectCard()}` is a function call — there's no data to serialize, no name to show in a command palette, no binding to remap. The user can't change "j means down" without editing code.

---

## Level 3: Commands

In Level 2, event handlers are function calls that execute and vanish. There's no record — no action vocabulary, no keybinding table, no data for AI to work with.

**The fix**: turn input into named, serializable commands. Instead of `if (input === "j") moveCursor(1)`, declare that `j` maps to the command `cursor_down`, and `cursor_down` produces the action `{ op: "moveCursor", delta: 1 }`. The mapping is data; the action is data; everything between keypress and state change is visible and customizable.

```tsx
import { pipe, withDomEvents, withCommands } from "inkx/runtime"

const registry = createCommandRegistry({
  cursor_down: {
    name: "Move Down",
    execute: (ctx) => ({ op: "moveCursor", delta: 1 }),
  },
  cursor_up: {
    name: "Move Up",
    execute: (ctx) => ({ op: "moveCursor", delta: -1 }),
  },
  toggle_done: {
    name: "Toggle Done",
    execute: (ctx) => ({ op: "toggleDone", index: ctx.cursor }),
  },
  select_node: {
    name: "Select",
    execute: (ctx) => ({ op: "select", nodeId: ctx.clickedNodeId }),
  },
})

const app = pipe(
  createApp(store, <Board />),
  withDomEvents(),
  withCommands({
    registry,
    getContext: () => buildContext(store),
    handleAction: (action) => store.apply(action),
    bindings: {
      key: { j: "cursor_down", k: "cursor_up", x: "toggle_done" },
      mouse: {
        click: (node) => "select_node",
        doubleClick: () => "enter_edit",
      },
    },
  }),
)
```

### What commands buy you

Once input is data, a whole class of problems becomes trivial:

- **Customizable keybindings** — the binding table is data, users can remap
- **Command palette** — `app.cmd.all()` lists every command with name, description, and current keys
- **AI automation** — `await app.cmd.cursor_down()` drives the app programmatically
- **Replay** — record the command stream, play it back
- **Testing** — `await app.cmd.toggle_done()` is more readable than `await app.press("x")`
- **Mouse commands** — clicks resolve to the same named actions as keys, unified in one vocabulary

### Mouse commands

Mouse events resolve to commands through the same registry. Click on a node → hit test finds the target → mouse binding resolves to `"select_node"` → command executes → action dispatched. Same path as keyboard, same serialization, same replay.

```tsx
mouse: {
  click: (node, mods) => {
    if (mods.ctrl) return "toggle_select"
    return "select_node"
  },
  doubleClick: () => "enter_edit",
  wheel: (delta) => delta < 0 ? "scroll_up" : "scroll_down",
}
```

### Hybrid: components + commands

Component handlers and commands aren't mutually exclusive. `withDomEvents()` fires first; if a component handles an event (stopPropagation), commands never see it. Unhandled events fall through to command resolution.

This is the natural pattern for complex apps: `TextInput` handles its own keys via `onKeyDown`, while navigation and actions go through commands.

```tsx
const app = pipe(
  createApp(store, <Board />),
  withDomEvents(),      // component handlers fire first
  withCommands(opts),   // unhandled events resolve to commands
)
```

### The driver pattern (testing + AI)

The `withKeybindings` and `withDiagnostics` plugins extend the app's external API for testing and automation:

```tsx
const driver = pipe(
  app,
  withKeybindings(bindings),  // press("j") → resolves keybinding → command
  withDiagnostics(),          // adds render invariant checks after each command
)

// AI or test can:
driver.cmd.all()              // list available commands
await driver.cmd.cursor_down() // execute by name
driver.getState()             // inspect state
await driver.screenshot()     // capture screen
```

This is the same app — just with more capabilities layered on. [State Management Level 3](state-management.md#level-3-ops-as-data--reduxs-insight) (ops as data) meets event handling Level 3 (commands). Together they make the entire app automatable: commands describe input, ops describe state changes, both are serializable data.

**The wall**: You want vim-style modal input (normal/insert/visual) or multi-key chords (gg, leader sequences). The built-in command resolution is single-key. You need to intercept events before they reach commands, with your own stateful logic.

---

## Level 4: App Plugins

Every extension in this guide — `withDomEvents`, `withCommands`, `withKeybindings`, `withDiagnostics` — is the same thing: an app plugin. A function that takes an app and returns an enhanced app.

```tsx
type AppPlugin<M, Msg> = (app: App<M, Msg>) => App<M, Msg>
```

This is the [SlateJS](https://docs.slatejs.org/concepts/08-plugins) editor model: `withHistory(withReact(createEditor()))`. Each plugin overrides methods on the app — `update` for event processing, `events` for event sources, `press`/`click` for the external API, or adds entirely new capabilities (`.cmd`, `.getState()`).

You compose them with `pipe()`:

```tsx
const app = pipe(
  createApp(store),                 // kernel: event loop + state
  withReact(<Board />),             // rendering: React + virtual buffer
  withOutput(stdout),               // terminal: alternate screen, diff output
  withTerminal(stdin),              // source: stdin → key/mouse/paste events
  withResize(stdout),               // source: SIGWINCH → resize events
  withLifecycle(),                  // processing: Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+C
  withFocus(),                      // processing: Tab navigation, focus scopes
  withMouse(),                      // protocol: SGR mouse tracking
  withDomEvents(),                  // processing: dispatch to component tree
  withCommands(opts),               // processing: resolve to named commands
  withKeybindings(bindings),        // API: press() → keybinding resolution
  withDiagnostics(),                // API: render invariant checks
)
```

### Writing your own plugin

A plugin overrides what it needs and passes everything else through. Here's a vim mode plugin that intercepts keys before commands:

```tsx
function withVimModes<M, Msg>(): AppPlugin<M, Msg> {
  let mode: "normal" | "insert" | "visual" = "normal"

  return (app) => {
    const { update } = app
    app.update = (msg, model) => {
      if (msg.type === "term:key") {
        // Mode switching
        if (mode === "normal" && msg.data.input === "i") {
          mode = "insert"
          return [model, []]  // consumed, don't pass through
        }
        if (mode === "insert" && msg.data.key.escape) {
          mode = "normal"
          return [model, []]
        }
        // In insert mode, let keys pass through to text input
        if (mode === "insert") {
          return update(msg, model)
        }
        // In normal mode, pass to command resolution
        return update(msg, model)
      }
      return update(msg, model)
    }
    return app
  }
}
```

Stack it:

```tsx
const app = pipe(
  createApp(store),
  withReact(<Board />),
  withOutput(stdout),
  withTerminal(stdin),
  withDomEvents(),
  withVimModes(),       // intercepts before commands
  withCommands(opts),
)
```

### Custom event sources

Plugins can also add event sources by overriding `app.events`:

```tsx
function withFileWatcher<M, Msg>(path: string): AppPlugin<M, Msg> {
  return (app) => {
    const { events, unmount } = app
    const watcher = watch(path, (ev) => app.dispatch({ type: "fs:change", data: ev }))
    app.events = () => [...events(), fileWatch(path)]
    app.unmount = () => { watcher.close(); unmount() }
    return app
  }
}
```

### Three mechanisms for event sources

Not all sources need to be app plugins. inkx provides three mechanisms, each for a different lifecycle:

| Mechanism | Lifecycle | Use when... |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **App plugins** | Static — created once at app setup | Always-on sources: stdin, resize, timers |
| **React components** | Reactive — mount/unmount with state | Conditional sources: file watchers, network polls |
| **Effects** | One-shot — triggered by update | Request/response: fetch, save, notifications |

React components are the most natural way to add reactive sources — they mount when state says so and clean up automatically:

```tsx
function FileWatcher({ path }: { path: string }) {
  const dispatch = useDispatch()

  useEffect(() => {
    const watcher = watch(path, (ev) =>
      dispatch({ type: "fs:change", data: ev })
    )
    return () => watcher.close()
  }, [path])

  return null  // renderless
}

// In your view — declarative, reactive
function App() {
  const vaultPath = useApp((s) => s.vaultPath)
  return <>
    <Board />
    {vaultPath && <FileWatcher path={vaultPath} />}
  </>
}
```

Vault opens → component mounts → watcher starts. Vault closes → unmounts → stops. Path changes → effect re-runs. React's reconciler IS the subscription manager.

### Type-safe events

All event types flow through a single `EventMap` — the contract between sources and update:

```tsx
interface EventMap {
  "term:key":    { input: string; key: Key }
  "term:mouse":  ParsedMouse
  "term:paste":  { text: string }
  "term:resize": { cols: number; rows: number }
}

// Derived discriminated union — narrows in switch
type AppEvent<K extends keyof EventMap = keyof EventMap> =
  K extends K ? { type: K; data: EventMap[K] } : never
```

Sources are typed against the map — they can only produce events they declare:

```tsx
function terminalInput(stdin): EventStream<AppEvent<"term:key" | "term:mouse" | "term:paste">>
```

Extend the map for custom events:

```tsx
interface MyEventMap extends EventMap {
  "fs:change": { path: string; kind: string }
  "timer:tick": { now: number }
}
```

TypeScript narrows automatically in update:

```tsx
function update(msg: AppEvent<keyof MyEventMap>, model: Model) {
  switch (msg.type) {
    case "term:key":   msg.data.input    // string
    case "fs:change":  msg.data.path     // string
    case "timer:tick": msg.data.now      // number
  }
}
```

### How `run()` wires it all

`app.run()` is called once. It:

1. Calls `app.events()` to get all static event streams
2. Merges them into a single `AsyncIterable`
3. Batches events by microtask (multiple events before next tick = one batch)
4. For each batch: calls `app.update(msg, model)` → new model + effects
5. React re-renders reactively when the model/store changes
6. Effect runners execute returned effects

The event loop is simple because the complexity lives in the plugins, not the runtime.

---

## The Plugin Model

Step back and look at what you have. Every extension — from mouse handling to vim modes to file watchers — is the same type: `(app) => app`. A function that takes an app and returns a richer app.

```
pipe(
  createApp(store)                 kernel: event loop + state
  ├─ withReact(<View />)           rendering: React + virtual buffer
  ├─ withOutput(stdout)            terminal: alternate screen, diff output
  ├─ withTerminal(stdin)           source: raw bytes → typed events
  ├─ withResize(stdout)            source: SIGWINCH → resize events
  ├─ withLifecycle()               processing: Ctrl+Z/Ctrl+C
  ├─ withFocus()                   processing: Tab navigation, focus scopes
  ├─ withDomEvents()               processing: dispatch to components
  ├─ withVimModes()                processing: modal key routing
  ├─ withCommands(opts)            processing: key/mouse → named commands
  ├─ withKeybindings(bindings)     API: press() → keybinding resolution
  └─ withDiagnostics()             API: render invariant checks
)
```

Three roles, one type:

| Role | What it does | Overrides |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **Source** | Produces events | `app.events` |
| **Processor** | Transforms/consumes events | `app.update` |
| **Driver** | Enhances external API | `app.press`, `app.cmd`, etc. |

A single plugin can fill multiple roles — `withCommands` overrides `update` (processing) AND adds `.cmd` (API). There's no taxonomy to learn; it's just functions overriding methods on an object.

### Relationship to state management

This guide is the input side of the same architecture described in [State Management](state-management.md):

| State Management | Event Handling |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Level 2: Shared store | Level 1: useInput callbacks |
| Level 3: Ops as data | Level 3: Commands (input as data) |
| Level 4: Effects as data | Level 4: Typed event sources |
| Level 5: Composition | Level 4: Plugin composition |

They meet at Level 3 — commands produce ops, ops describe state changes, both are serializable data. Together they make the entire app a pure pipeline from input to output: events → commands → ops → state → effects → I/O.

---

## Built-in Plugins

Every built-in behavior is a plugin. `run()` composes them for you; `pipe()` lets you pick.

### Kernel

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `createApp(store)` | Kernel | Typed event loop: `update`, `dispatch`, `events`, `run`. No rendering, no terminal, no I/O. |

### Rendering

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `withReact(<El />)` | Rendering | React reconciler + virtual buffer. Mounts the element, renders into a `TerminalBuffer`, re-renders reactively on store changes. |
| `withOutput(stdout)` | Terminal | Alternate screen, raw mode, cursor management, incremental diff output. Converts buffer to ANSI and writes to stdout. |

### Event Sources

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `withTerminal(stdin)` | Source | Parses raw stdin bytes into typed events: `term:key`, `term:mouse`, `term:paste`. Handles ANSI sequences, SGR mouse, Kitty keyboard, bracketed paste. |
| `withResize(stdout)` | Source | Listens for SIGWINCH → emits `term:resize` with new `cols`/`rows`. |

### Event Processing

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `withLifecycle(opts?)` | Processing | Intercepts Ctrl+Z (suspend/resume) and Ctrl+C (exit). Saves/restores terminal state across suspend. Hooks: `onSuspend`, `onResume`, `onInterrupt`. |
| `withFocus()` | Processing | Focus manager: Tab/Shift+Tab navigation, Enter to enter scope, Escape to exit. Dispatches `onKeyDown`/`onKeyDownCapture` through focus tree (capture → target → bubble). |
| `withDomEvents()` | Processing | DOM-like event dispatch for mouse: hit testing via `screenRect`, bubbling through ancestors. `onClick`, `onDoubleClick`, `onMouseDown`, `onMouseUp`, `onMouseMove`, `onMouseEnter`, `onMouseLeave`, `onWheel`. |
| `withCommands(opts)` | Processing + API | Resolves key and mouse events to named commands via a binding table. Adds `.cmd` proxy for programmatic invocation. Adds `.getState()` for introspection. |

### Protocol

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `withMouse()` | Protocol | Enables SGR mouse tracking (mode 1006). Disables on cleanup. |
| `withKitty(flags?)` | Protocol | Enables Kitty keyboard protocol. Detects support, enables with flags, disables on cleanup. |
| `withPaste()` | Protocol | Enables bracketed paste mode. |

### Testing / Automation

| Plugin | Role | What it does |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `withKeybindings(bindings)` | API | Intercepts `press()` to resolve keybindings → commands before passing through. `press("j")` becomes `cmd.cursor_down()`. |
| `withDiagnostics(opts?)` | API | Adds render invariant checks after each command: incremental vs fresh render, stability, replay, layout. Captures screenshots on failure. |

### How `run()` composes them

```tsx
// run(store, element, options) is equivalent to:
function run(store, element, options = {}) {
  return pipe(
    createApp(store),
    withReact(element),
    withOutput(options.stdout ?? process.stdout),
    withTerminal(options.stdin ?? process.stdin),
    withResize(options.stdout ?? process.stdout),
    withLifecycle({
      onSuspend: options.onSuspend,
      onResume: options.onResume,
      onInterrupt: options.onInterrupt,
    }),
    withFocus(),
    options.mouse && withMouse(),
    options.kitty && withKitty(options.kitty === true ? undefined : options.kitty),
    options.paste !== false && withPaste(),
    withDomEvents(),
  ).run()
}
```

Every option on `run()` maps to a plugin. When you need more control — custom processing, custom sources, testing drivers — drop down to `pipe()` and compose exactly what you need.

---

## Prior Art

The composable plugin model draws from several traditions:

| System | Pattern | Similarity |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **[SlateJS](https://docs.slatejs.org/)** | `withHistory(withReact(createEditor()))` | Same `(editor) => editor` plugin shape — override methods via closure |
| **[Lexical](https://lexical.dev/)** (Facebook) | Command registration + listeners | Plugins declare what they handle rather than wrapping everything |
| **[ProseMirror](https://prosemirror.net/)** | Structured plugin hooks | `handleKeyDown`, `decorations`, transaction filters — declarative, less free-form |
| **[Express](https://expressjs.com/)** / **[Koa](https://koajs.com/)** | `app.use(middleware)` | Onion model — last registered = outermost wrapper |
| **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** middleware | `(store) => (next) => (action) => result` | `(inner) => wrapped` composition |
| **[Elm](https://guide.elm-lang.org/)** subscriptions | `subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg` | Declarative event sources (we use React components instead) |
| **DOM Events** | `addEventListener`, capture/bubble | `withDomEvents()` implements this for terminal UI |

The key insight from SlateJS: the editor (or app) is a plain object with overridable methods. Plugins don't use a special registration API — they just override methods and capture the originals via closure. This makes every plugin independently testable and composable without framework support.

The contrast from Lexical and ProseMirror: more structured plugin models are easier to reason about and debug, at the cost of flexibility. inkx takes the SlateJS path (maximum flexibility) but mitigates with clear conventions, good defaults via `run()`, and dev tooling (`withDiagnostics`).

## Trade-offs

**When callbacks are fine.** At Level 1, `useInput` is a function call — simple, debuggable, zero indirection. If you have one component handling all input, stay here. Most simple tools never need more.

**The costs of component handlers (Level 2).** Hit testing runs on every mouse event. Event dispatch walks the tree. For most apps this is negligible, but with thousands of nodes and high-frequency mouse events (drag), it shows up. Profile before optimizing.

**The costs of commands (Level 3).** Same trade-offs as [ops as data](state-management.md#trade-offs-when-data-goes-too-far): more indirection, a command registry to maintain, binding tables to keep in sync. The payoff — customizable bindings, AI automation, replay — is real but only matters if you use it.

**The costs of custom plugins (Level 4).** Plugin ordering matters — `withVimModes()` before `withCommands()` means vim intercepts first. The override chain is a stack of closures, so debugging goes through multiple layers. Name your plugins well and keep them focused.

**The honest rule of thumb**: if `useInput` handles your needs, stop at Level 1. If you need clicks, go to Level 2. If you need customizable bindings or automation, go to Level 3. Level 4 is for when the built-ins don't cover your use case. Each level adds power and complexity in equal measure.
